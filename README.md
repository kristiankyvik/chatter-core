# Chatter, the core functionality
---

## WARNING: Pre-Alpha state, bugs and missing functionality everywhere!

This package contains models and functionality for Chatter, and can be used with your own UI package. Otherwise, see the [chatter-semantic]() package for a full UI package.


Chatter has the ambition of becoming an easy to set up in-app chat package that requires minimal configuration to run, yet can be heavily customized to fit your needs should you wish. The current state of in-app chat felt lacking, hence this project was born. I will be using this in my own production apps, so it will not be going away in the near future.
